## CODE ERROR
I am unable to locally run my code as receive an "MongooseServerSelectionError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017" error from my MongoDB when locally hosting. In short its an error with the installation of any version of MongoDB to my system. I worked with my professor on this issue and we were able to come up with a work around by using MongoDB Atlas and Compass which worked for a while but as I step away to work on other project but when I came back and tried to run the application the "MongooseServerSelectionError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017" error started again. At this point I am unsure of what to do to fix the issue on my end. This error of prevents me from looking at and testing the application in a web page and deploying to Render. When my code did run I was able to see that I had a few error related Apollo but I was unable to look further into those before the MongoDB error reoccur.
